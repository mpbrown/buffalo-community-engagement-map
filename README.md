# Buffalo Community Engagement Workshop
This site lets people explore community engagement opportunities around Buffalo, NY. 

Every spring and fall, I host a civic engagement workshop with the University at Buffalo Office of Scholarships and Fellowships SPARK program. The workshop is designed to help first year students discover ways to get involved in the Buffalo community and help them establish those connections.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling the in-person workshop, I adapted the activities to an online format that students could participate in from any web browser.
